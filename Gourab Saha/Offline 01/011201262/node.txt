This is a C++ header file defining a template class Node that represents a node in a doubly-linked list. Here is a line-by-line explanation of the code:

c++
Copy code
#ifndef NODE_H
#define NODE_H
These are preprocessor directives that ensure the header file is only included once in the compilation process. NODE_H is a macro defined to avoid multiple inclusions of the same header file.

c++
Copy code
template <typename T>
This is a template declaration that allows the class to be instantiated with a generic type T.

c++
Copy code
class Node {
public:
    T data;
    Node<T>* next;
    Node<T>* prev;
These are public member variables of the class representing the data stored in the node, the next and previous nodes in the list.

c++
Copy code
    Node() : data(T()), next(nullptr), prev(nullptr) {}
This is a default constructor that initializes a Node object with default values. It initializes data with the default value of type T, next and prev with nullptr.

c++
Copy code
    Node(T data) : data(data), next(nullptr), prev(nullptr) {}
This is a constructor that initializes a Node object with a specified value for data and nullptr for next and prev.

c++
Copy code
};

#endif // NODE_H
